Step 1: Write this command in your terminal, to create a nodejs application, because our express server will work inside the node application.
npm init

npm install express

const express = require('express'); 
  
const app = express(); 
const PORT = 3000; 
  
app.listen(PORT, (error) =>{ 
    if(!error) 
        console.log("Server is Successfully Running,  
                   and App is listening on port "+ PORT) 
    else 
        console.log("Error occurred, server can't start", error); 
    } 
);
